Project Introduction:

AtliQ Mart, a leading retail chain in South India with 50+ supermarkets, launched a large-scale promotional campaign during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 on its in-house branded products. The sales director needed a clear understanding of which promotions contributed significantly to sales and which underperformed, in order to plan better strategies for future festive campaigns.

This project involved analyzing sales performance across different stores, product categories, and promotion types. A dynamic dashboard was built in Power BI to present high-impact insights, and SQL was used to fulfill critical ad-hoc executive queries.
